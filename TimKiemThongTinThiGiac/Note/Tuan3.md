<h3>Vector Space Model</h3>


- RELEVANCE = Similarity 

Assumptions:

- Query and documents are represented in the same form: 
    - A query can be regarded as a "document"

- Relevance(d,q) = similarity(d, q)


- Represent both doc and query by concept vectors.

    - Each concept defines one dimenstion
    - K concepts define a high-dimensional space
    - Element ò vector coresponds to concept weight 
- Measure Relevance
    - Distance between the query vector and document vector in this concept space.
