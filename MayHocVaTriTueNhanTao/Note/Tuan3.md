<H3>NIDS - Netword instruction Detection system</H3>

- Main Goals
    - Detect wide variety of instruction
    - Detect instructions in timely fashion
    - Present the analysis in a simple, easy to understand format
    - Is Accurate


- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can be divided into:
    - Signature-based system
    - anomaly-based

- Anomally
    - Accuracy
